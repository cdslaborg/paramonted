This file contains information about the ParaMonte library build configuration flags.

The ParaMonte library build scripts accept a large number of 
optional flags that can be used to configure the library build.

Nearly all configuration flags can be specified as command line arguments
to the [install.bat](./install.bat.md), [install.sh](./install.sh.md), or 
the [CMake binary executable](./CMakeLists.md). Some flags may be essential
to directly call the CMake executable binary, while others are available
only as optional arguments to the library install scripts mentioned above.

Due to the sheer number of available optional flags, they are categorized 
in tiers sorted by their relevance and importance to the end users.

1.  [TIER-1 ParaMonte library build configuration flags](#TIER-1-ParaMonte-library-build-configuration-flags)
2.  [TIER-2 ParaMonte library build configuration flags](#TIER-2-ParaMonte-library-build-configuration-flags)
3.  [TIER-3 ParaMonte library build configuration flags](#TIER-3-ParaMonte-library-build-configuration-flags)
4.  [TIER-4 ParaMonte library build configuration flags](#TIER-4-ParaMonte-library-build-configuration-flags)

## TIER-1 ParaMonte library build configuration flags

The ParaMonte TIER-1 build flags set the most important and useful build configurations.
Assuming the required compilers and external (e.g., Coarray, MPI parallel) libraries are 
available on the system, these flags can readily customized the library build.

### `build`

Specifies the library build type for which the library will be built.

+   Usage (with `install.bat` or `install.sh`)
    ```bash
    --build "build_type"
    ```
+   Usage (with `cmake` binary executable)
    ```cmake
    -Dbuild="build_type"
    ```

where `build_type` can be any of the following values.

Value               | Usage
--------------------|------
`debug`             | For debugging.
`testing`           | For quick testing with minimal optimizations.
`release`           | For production-ready application builds (default).
`ipo`               | Same as specifying `release` but with link-time optimizations.
`tuned`             | Same as specifying `ipo` but builds for all supported architectures.
`native`            | Same as specifying `ipo` but builds only for the current architecture (**non-portable**).

> When specified for install scripts, the `build` flag can take a semi-colon-separated
list of library build values for which the library will be built in the specified order.

> If `testing` is specified, it is automatically converted to `RelwithDebInfo`.

> This option, if provided, will overwrite the value of `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` in CMake scripts.

> Beware that `ipo`, `tuned`, `native` builds are currently only recognized
used with the `intel` and `gnu` Fortran compilers. If specified with unsupported
compilers, they are automatically converted to `release`.

> The `ipo`, `tuned`, and `native` builds can take very long and generate large binaries.

**optional**. The default value for `build_type` is `release`.

### `lang`

Specifies the target programming language(s) for
which the library will be built and accessed from.

+   Usage (with `install.bat` or `install.sh`)
    ```bash
    --lang "programming_language"
    ```
+   Usage (with `cmake` binary executable)
    ```cmake
    -Dlang="programming_language"
    ```

Value               | Usage
--------------------|------
`stack`             | All arrays (, if possible, including allocatable,) are stored on the Stack
`heap`              | Most arrays of significant size (e.g., > 10 elements) will be stored on the Heap.

> The use of Heap memory can be significantly slower than the Stack in isolated cases.

> The stack memory allocations can lead to "stack overflow" or "segmentation fault"
that are frequently extremely hard to identify.

> If you use `stack` be sure to increase the stack memory allocated
by the Operating System for your output binary before execution.

> When specified for install scripts, the `mem` flag can take a semi-colon-separated
list of possible values for which the library will be built in the specified order.

> When specified for install scripts, the `par` flag can take a semi-colon-separated
list of possible values for which the library will be built in the specified order.

> Beware that the Coarray parallelism in the current library version 2.0 is non-functional.

**optional**. The default value for `parallelization_type` is `none`.

## TIER-2 ParaMonte library build configuration flags

The ParaMonte TIER-2 build flags set the additional optional arguments that 
run library benchmarks, examples, or tests, or are critical for the correct 
selection of compilers or external compilation libraries, or customize the
build and installation folders.

> Relative paths currently result in library build failure.

**optional**. The default value for `cmake_build_directory_path` is,

```bash
bdir="${root}/bld/${os}/${arch}/${csid}${csvs}/${build}/${lib}/${mem}/${par}/${checking}/${lang}"
```

where

+   `${root}`   is replaced with the path to the root directory of the project where the LICENSE file exists.

> via the default OpenBLAS local external submodule of the ParaMonte library,
> if the OpenBLAS submodule exists in the `external` folder of the local clone
> of the ParaMonte repository. If the local copy of `OpenBLAS` library exists,
> the library will be linked against OpenBLAS, otherwise, the library will be
> built without any BLAS dependency.

`none`              | The build is configured for no testing.
`all`               | The build activates all library tests.

> **WARNING**
> Enabling tests requires setting the value of the build flag `mod` to `"all"`.
> This is particularly important for the programming languages other than Fortran
> where the default value of `mod` is usually not `"all"`.

> **WARNING**
> The ParaMonte extended precision tests are prone to failure.
> This is due to GNU compiler bugs for extended precision arithmetic.
> To avoid bug-induced test failures when using GNU compilers,

> Python script in the corresponding language subfolder of the `benchmark`
> folder in the root directory of the project.

> Specific items in a given file can be excluded by
> adding an exclamation mark at the beginning of the line.

> Setting this option to anything other than `none` will lead to running
the Python postprocessing scripts for the corresponding ParaMonte library
benchmarks that have been previously built and run on the command line.

> Frequently, postprocessing scripts merely generate visualizations.
> The visualizations are essential for the ParaMonte library documentation.

> Setting this option to anything other than `none` will lead to running
> the corresponding ParaMonte library benchmarks postprocessing scripts on the command line.

> The benchmarks postprocessing scripts will be executed in the corresponding library benchmark subfolder in the build folder.

> Not all supported programming languages may have benchmarks postprocessing scripts.
> Check the `benchmark` folder in the root directory of the repository before using this flag.

## TIER-4 ParaMonte library build configuration flags

The ParaMonte TIER-4 build flags set the additional optional arguments that 
change the behavior of the library at the lowest level by setting the types.  
These build flags are mostly relevant to the ParaMonte library developers or 
advanced users who wish to reduce the final library size or supported types.  

The values of these build options are automatically set by the CMake scripts.  
Changing the default behavior requires careful attention to the consequences.  

The Fortran language 2023 supports five intrinsic types:

+   character
+   integer
+   logical
+   complex
+   real

each of which can have a range of possible kind type
parameter values that are specific to the compiler and platform.

The ParaMonte library currently allows building the library for
up to 5 different kind type parameters as specified by the
following variables in the `iso_fortran_env` intrinsic
module of the standard:

Value                   | Usage
------------------------|------
`character_kinds`       | The constant vector of supported character kinds.
`integer_kinds`         | The constant vector of supported integer kinds.
`logical_kinds`         | The constant vector of supported logical kinds.
`real_kinds`            | The constant vector of supported complex/real kinds.

By default, the library is built for all supported kinds that are **fully** supported by the compiler.
This can lead to code bloat and long compilation times if all kinds are activated.
If only specific kinds are desired, the following flags can be used to build the
library only for the selected kinds (specified by their element indices in the
corresponding constant vectors from the `iso_fortran_env` intrinsic module).

> The unicode support within gfortran is an example of a type kind parameter
> that is supported by the compiler but not fully implemented and not functional.
> As such, the type kind parameter corresponding to uniccode is dropped in the library build.

> **WARNING**
> If you specify any of the optional kind-type-parameter-selection command arguments,
> always ensure to minimally specify the default supported kind type parameters by the processor.
> For example, the Fortran standard requires support for at least two `real` kind type parameters.
> Additionally, the standard requires minimal support for at least two `integer` kind type parameters.
> Additionally, the standard requires minimal support for at least one `logical` kind type parameters.

### `ski`

Specifies a list of `character` kind indices

    ```

where `character_kinds_indices` is a semicolon-separated list of
indices of the `character_kinds(:)` constant vector of `iso_fortran_env`
intrinsic module of Fortran.

For example, setting `character_kinds_indices` to `1;3;6` will
build the library for the kinds in `character_kinds([1, 3, 6])`.

> No more than fives indices can be simultaneously specified in every single build, because
> the ParaMonte library is currently configured for builds with up to fives kinds for each type.

> The minimally-required `character` type kind parameter indices for the Intel and GNU compilers are `1`.

> No more than fives indices can be simultaneously specified in every single build, because
> the ParaMonte library is currently configured for builds with up to 5 kinds for each type.

> The complex kinds can be normally limited to only the two default compiler
> choices for the complex kind without any harm to the library build and run.
> This can lead to noticeable savings in library size and build time.

> The minimally-required `complex` type kind parameter indices for the Intel and GNU compilers are `1;2`.

> **WARNING** Beware some ParaMonte algorithms require compatible `complex` and `real` kind,
> necessitating the use of the same kind type parameters for both data types.

> the ParaMonte library is currently configured for builds with up to fives kinds for each type.

> If ever specified, always ensure the two default integer kinds supported by
> the Fortran programming language are included in the specified list of indices.

> The minimally-required `integer` type kind parameter indices for the Intel and GNU compilers are `3;4`.
