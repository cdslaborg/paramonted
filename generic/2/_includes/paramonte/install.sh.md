##  Building via `install.sh` script in Bash terminal (macOS, Linux, MinGW, MSYS2, WSL)

+   The ParMonte library ships with a Bash script file named `install.sh` written in
    the Bash scripting language in the root directory of the ParaMonte repository.
+   This script is a convenience wrapper around the lower-level CMake build instructions
    below and automates most installation steps on Unix (Bash) terminals.
+   This is the recommended build mechanism on **macOS** and **Linux** systems.

### Building via `install.sh` script in Bash terminal - quick start

Run the script `install.sh` on an Intel-aware Command Prompt for Windows as:

```bash  
./install.sh --lang TARGET_LANAGUAGE
```  

and to redirect the `install.sh` script output to a file named `install.sh.out`, try:

```bash  
./install.sh --lang TARGET_LANAGUAGE > install.sh.out 2>&1
```  

and to redirect and run the `install.sh` script in the background, try:

```bash  
./install.sh --lang TARGET_LANAGUAGE > install.sh.out 2>&1 &
```  

and to redirect and run the `install.sh` script and disown the process, try:

```bash  
./install.sh --lang TARGET_LANAGUAGE > install.sh.out 2>&1 & jobs; disown
```  

where you must replace `TARGET_LANAGUAGE` with your choice of programming
language from which you intend to access the ParaMonte library. See the
command-line configuration flag descriptions below for a list of
supported programming languages and other build options.

### Building via `install.sh` script in Bash terminal - prerequisites

You will need the following components installed
on your PC to successfully run `install.sh` script.

1.  A recent version (`>2018`) installation of **CMake** build generator software.  
    This application can be freely [downloaded and installed](https://cmake.org/download/).

2.  A recent **C and Fortran compilers** minimally supporting Fortran 2008.  

    + GNU and Intel compilers are popular compiler choices for **Linux** systems.  

    + GNU and NAG compilers are popular compiler choices for **macOS** systems.  

        Although NAG is an excellent Fortran compiler choice, it is untested.

    +   Two popular compiler choices for **WSL**, **MSYS2**, and **MinGW** Windows 
        environments for systems are GNU and Intel compilers.  

    +   Building via **Intel compilers** requires a recent version (`>2023`) 
        installation of Intel OneAPI and HPC Toolkits on your system.  
        The Intel OneAPI can be freely downloaded and installed by anyone.

    +   Building via GNU compilers requires a recent version (`>10`) 
        installation of GNU C and Fortran compilers.  

    +   Building for **MPI-parallelism** requires either,

        +   the Intel MPI library with Intel compilers, or
        +   the MPICH MPI library with GNU compilers, or
        +   the Open-MPI library with GNU compilers, or
        +   the Microsoft MPI library with GNU compilers (on Windows).

3.  Once all the above components are installed, open a Windows CMD terminal that
    recognizes all applications installed above (that is, all applications can
    be found in the `PATH` environment variable).

6.  Navigate to the folder containing the ParaMonte repository on your system.

7.  Type `install.sh` with the desired build configuration flags. Example:

    ```shch
    ./install.sh --lang c
    ```

    ```shch
    ./install.sh --lang c --build release --par mpi --checking nocheck
    ```

    ```shch
    ./install.sh --lang c --build release --par "mpi;omp" --checking nocheck
    ```

    Check out [install.config.md](./install.config.md) file for a full list of build configuration flags.
