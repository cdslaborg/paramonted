{% include warning.html content="Do not specify more parallel (MPI or Coarray) tasks than the available number of physical processors on your system. If there are fewer physical processors available on the machine than the requested parallel tasks, some processors will be assigned more than one task. This will significantly degrade the performance of your simulation and will potentially eliminate any benefits gained from running your simulation in parallel. For example, if you are running a parallel simulation on a quad-core laptop (with four physical processors), then the maximum number of parallel tasks should not go beyond 4 under any circumstances (for example, set **`-n 3`** or **`-n 4`** at most, when invoking the MPI launcher)." %}
