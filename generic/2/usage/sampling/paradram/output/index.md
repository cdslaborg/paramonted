## The five different types of output files  

Every **successful** ParaDRAM simulation generates (at least) 5 output files with the following suffixes,  

-   `_progress.txt`  
-   `_report.txt`  
-   `_sample.txt`  
-   `_chain.txt` or `_chain.bin` (for output chain files in binary format)  
-   `_restart.txt` or `_restart.bin` (for output restart files in binary format)  

Each of the output files is **prefixed** with the filename that the user provides via the simulation specification variable `outputFileName` as [described here](../../{{pmSampler|downcase}}/specifications/#outputfilename){:target="_blank"}. If this variable is missing in the input specifications, the {{pmSampler}} routine will automatically generate a new random file name with a format similar to the following,  

```
ParaDRAM_20240312_060333_408_run1_pid1_progress.txt
ParaDRAM_20240312_060333_408_run1_pid1_restart.txt
ParaDRAM_20240312_060333_408_run1_pid1_report.txt
ParaDRAM_20240312_060333_408_run1_pid1_sample.txt
ParaDRAM_20240312_060333_408_run1_pid1_chain.txt
```  

where `_pid1` in the filenames implies that these files have been generated by the first processor/thread in the simulation, whether the simulation is in parallel or serial. See the [documentation](../../{{pmSampler|downcase}}/specifications/#outputfilename){:target="_blank"} of the simulation specification `outputFileName` for a complete detailed description of the pattern of the randomly generated filename.

{{site.data.alerts.important}}
When the simulation is performed in the multi-chain parallelism mode, specified by the input variable, <b><pre>parallelism = "multiChain"</pre></b> <b>each</b> leader process (that is, all processes in the <b><code>multiChain</code></b> parallel simulation) will generate 5 <b>separate</b> output files in the simulation. Each set of five files contains information about the <b>unique simulation</b> that has been <b>performed by the corresponding process</b>.
